# Syle OS - The worst OS you will ever see

**Current tasks:**
- Organize the code and split it into multiple files
- Add more functionality
- Replace grub with own multiboot bootloader

## What will the finished OS be?
The finished Operating System will have most basic features such as, file creation, reading from disk, and a basic FAT16 filesystem. It will also consist of a basic shell which can do tasks such as removing, creating files and way more.
## Is it near completion, when will it be finished?
No, it is not anywhere **near** completion, it will take years for it to be finished. I'm not thinking of stopping working on this project anytime soon.
