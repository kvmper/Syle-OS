# Syle OS - The worst OS you will ever see

**Current tasks:**
- Organize the code and split it into multiple files
- Replace grub with a custom multiboot bootloader
- Add more functionality
- Add documentation
- Optimize
## What will the finished OS be?
The finished Operating System will have most basic features such as, file creation, reading from disk, and a basic FAT16 filesystem. It will also consist of a basic shell which can do tasks such as removing, creating files and way more.
## Is it near completion, when will it be finished?
No, it is not anywhere **near** completion, it will take years for it to be finished. I'm not thinking of stopping working on this project anytime soon. I'm looking for people who will help me find issues with this project and provide recommendations to improve the project as it grows.
